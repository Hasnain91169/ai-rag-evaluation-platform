# ai-rag-evaluation-platform
This project demonstrates how to build production-minded evaluation and observability infrastructure for RAG-based AI systems. Rather than focusing on model training, it focuses on measuring, diagnosing, and improving AI quality over time - including retrieval failures, prompting issues, and latency drift.
